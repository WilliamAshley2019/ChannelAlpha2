This is very early into a much larger project concept.

Basically the idea here is to make a parallel audio controller that is comprised of a group of plugins.   The channel plugin aims to emulate the channel controls  fader / selector buttons and pan.     T

The controller module is to link all the various channel controlleres (channels basically channel strips)

The control module is not only to control routing but also link channels to "rack" elements so the concept to build a module rack that will allow indivudal modular effects to be linked to the channels.

TO ADD
currently each channel is user selectable 1 through 32

The idea is to allow "common mode" for each channel so that audio can be shared and used as a channel summmer for all audio sources goinginto that via a "bus link" plugin.
